                <p>Abeona Voyages was founded in 2020 by Shanna (CEO) & James, both with an extensive background in travel ecommerce and distribution technology, as well as hotel operations and strategies.</p>
                <p>Shanna & James are true business developers and have been involved in hospitality start-ups and early days ventures.</p> 
                <p>‘We saw a large opportunity in the hotel industry post-covid for independent hotels. In the age of user generated content (online reviews) and a thirst for authentic experiences by consumers, originality stands to flourish. Independent hotels by their nature have a tremendous upside that can be leveraged into successful business results.’</p>
